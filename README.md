## ADMINER

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/en) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. Conversely to phpMyAdmin, it consist of a single file ready to deploy to the target server. Adminer is available for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Elasticsearch, MongoDB and others via plugin.


## Production vs. development

- For production environments, it is not advisable to make Adminer publicly accessible. Consider either disabling ```Public Access through the Zerops.io subdomain```  after deployment in GUI  or directly setting `enableSubdomainAccess` to `false` in import file.
- To access Adminer in production environment you can use a  [VPN](https://docs.zerops.io/references/vpn) through [ZCLI](https://docs.zerops.io/references/cli). Once connected, Adminer will be available at the address `adminer.zerops` (or whatever hostname you set).
